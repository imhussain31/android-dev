The error code

IS9810 / 6050 / ywsSTVahnjl

in Samsung In-App Purchase (IAP) usually means “Service unavailable” because the device or account cannot connect to Samsung’s payment service at that moment.
For IS9810, Samsung’s docs say it’s a temporary service unavailability error—often caused by environment, configuration, or connectivity issues.

Common Causes & Fixes

1️⃣ Test Environment Not Set Correctly

If you’re testing in developer mode or with a sandbox account, make sure:

Galaxy Store is installed and updated on the device.

You’re logged in to a Samsung Account that is added as a tester in the Samsung Seller Portal.

You’re using the correct IAP Mode (IapHelper.IAP_MODE_TEST for testing).


If you try to purchase a real item in test mode (or a test item in live mode), you’ll get this error.


2️⃣ Samsung IAP SDK Not Updated

Make sure you’re using the latest Samsung IAP SDK (current version is 6.x).

Older SDK versions sometimes cause IS9810 due to SSL or API changes.


3️⃣ Item Not Published or Wrong Item ID

If the item’s Product ID in your code doesn’t exactly match the ID in the Seller Portal, Samsung IAP will fail.

Ensure the item status in the Seller Portal is Published and the app is updated with that ID.


4️⃣ Device / Region Restrictions

Samsung IAP only works in supported countries.

If your Samsung account’s country doesn’t match the app’s distribution country, it can return IS9810.


5️⃣ Temporary Server Issue

Sometimes it’s just downtime on Samsung’s end. Try again after 10–15 minutes or on another network (Wi-Fi vs. mobile data).
